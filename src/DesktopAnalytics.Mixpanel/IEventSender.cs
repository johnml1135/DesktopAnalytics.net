	/// Implementations must never throw (synchronously or as a faulted task): the flush loop (via the
	/// Polly-wrapped call in <see cref="MixpanelClient"/>) treats an exception the same as
	/// <see cref="SendResult.RetryableFailure"/>, but a well-behaved sender should catch its own
	/// network/timeout exceptions and return <see cref="BatchSendResult.Retryable"/> directly.
